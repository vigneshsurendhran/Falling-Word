# Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game

- For each game new set of words will be prepared by taking 10 random words from file
- Each word will be shown and will be disappeared after 3 seconds if user didn't answer for the question it will considered wrong answer and also if user answered before the time limit user will moved to next question. 
- Once the game is completed, User can play again. 

# Decisions made because of restricted time

- Didn't make separate UI to show the score after completion of the game
- Didn't concentrate on Ui decoration(Like attractive design for falling word, etc), focused on testable code, clean code and business logic

# what would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time

- Improving the UI by applying clean UI and animation 
- UI testing
